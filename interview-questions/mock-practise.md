# Difference Between TLS and SSL

## Overview
TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are cryptographic protocols for securing network communications. TLS is the modern, secure replacement for the deprecated SSL.

## Comparison Table

| Feature       | SSL (Deprecated)           | TLS (Current Standard)              |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Versions** | SSL 2.0, 3.0              | TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3             |
| **Security** | Vulnerable (POODLE, etc.) | More secure (AES, ECC, etc.)        |
| **Handshake**| Slower                    | Faster (especially TLS 1.3)         |
| **Usage**    | No longer supported       | Required for modern security        |

## Key Takeaways
- **SSL is obsolete** and insecure (all versions should be disabled).
- **TLS 1.2 or 1.3** is the current security standard.
- TLS offers stronger encryption, faster handshakes, and better vulnerability protection.
